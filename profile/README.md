# **SubSpectra** 
### custom firmware
***

SubSpectra is the organization behind the SubSpectra custom firmware for Flipper Zero devices. We build, maintain, and document an extensible custom firmware distribution intended to expand the capabilities of Flipper Zero hardware for lawful research, testing, and hobbyist use.

This README gives a high-level overview of the project, community guidelines, and legal terms. For code, releases, installation instructions, and issue tracking please see the specific repository for the firmware: https://github.com/SubSpectra/flipper-zero-firmware (replace with the actual repo URL).

About
-----
SubSpectra produces a community-driven custom firmware for Flipper Zero devices. Our goal is to provide well-documented, maintainable, and testable firmware improvements and optional features that empower researchers, hardware hackers, and hobbyists to experiment with the device while encouraging responsible, lawful behavior.

What is SubSpectra custom firmware
---------------------------------
The SubSpectra firmware is a fork/extension of the Flipper Zero firmware ecosystem (see the firmware repository for exact lineage and third-party components). It may include:
- additional device features and apps,
- experimental tools for signal inspection and debugging,
- UI improvements and quality-of-life enhancements,
- optional integrations and community-contributed plugins.

Key features (examples)
-----------------------
- Modular apps and plugin architecture
- Improved UI workflows for common tasks
- Optional developer/debugging tools
- Device profiles and experimental drivers
- Funny animations
- Advanced Sub ghz.
- Games

Compatibility & safety
----------------------
- Supported devices: Flipper Zero (check the firmware repo for exact supported hardware and model constraints).
- Installing third‑party firmware can void your device warranty and may brick your device if done incorrectly. Proceed only if you accept those risks.
- SubSpectra firmware may modify device operation. Use the firmware responsibly and only on devices you own or are explicitly authorized to modify.
- We do not condone or support using this firmware for illegal activities (unauthorized access, evading protections, committing fraud, etc.). See Legal Terms below.

Getting started
---------------
- Visit the firmware repository for release downloads, installation instructions, and the changelog: https://github.com/SubSpectra/flipper-zero-firmware
- Follow device- and platform-specific instructions provided in the repo. Do not follow untrusted or unknown guides.
- If you are unsure whether a feature or usage is lawful in your jurisdiction, consult a qualified legal advisor.

Contribution & community
------------------------
We welcome contributions: bug reports, documentation fixes, tests, code, and design improvements.

Please follow these org-level expectations:
- Read the repository CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (if present).
- Open issues for non-trivial changes before submitting large PRs.
- Keep PRs focused and include tests/documentation for behavior changes.
- Respect maintainers' reviews and be responsive to feedback.

Suggested labels across the org:
- good first issue
- help wanted
- bug
- enhancement
- docs

Security disclosures
--------------------
If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead:
- Send an encrypted report to our security contact: subspectra@finnsabia.com
